# Welcome to my GitHub repository on classifier to predict whether the people suffer from heart disease or not

#Objective:
This is example of the classifier:

The repository is a learning exercise to:
1. Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
2. Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
3. Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process.
4. Identifying the problem and Data Sources
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Pre-Processing the Data
7. Build model based on classifier to pedict whether the patient suffers from heart disease or not.
